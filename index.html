    will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i
    have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a

    work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow
    by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than belore it was Buli will

    <b> Steve Jobs </b> <br>
    What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story lve writen
    as an aduit (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every
    email I've EVer written, has been written on machines created by Appie. I
    interacted online using an Appie machine long before l ever encountered a
    PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid.
    And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be
    missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work. <br>

    <b> He's gone.. </b> <br>
    A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt ike |
    knew him. Iwill forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he was
    taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly
    gained an angel. <br>

    <b> I will always remember Steve! </b> <br>

    my feelings... For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple
    products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of course, I've
    been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple Is
    Connected with Steve. do hope hell be remembered around the world as a
